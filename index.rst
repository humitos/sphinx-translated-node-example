 Hello Translated World
========================

This is a minimal example of how developers can use the ``translated`` node attribute to build different Sphinx extensions.
It highlights (in green) via CSS the translated paragraphs and shows the translated percetange of each document.

.. note::

   The source language is English and the target language is Spanish.

This file is translated at |translated-page-percentage| %

This is a file written in English that will be translated to Spanish.

This paragraph should be missing the Spanish translation and it is shown in it's original language.
